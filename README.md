# Discleamer
It is an unofficial LaTeX template for the theses of the graduate İzmir 
Institute of Technology students. This template is for assistance only, and the 
repository contributor(s) assumes no liability. 
**There are still bugs and mistakes!**

# Usage
You can edit the allowed area in the `main.tex` file. You can create a new TeX 
file in the chapters directory, and input in the `main.tex` file just as 
`guide.tex`. The `guide.tex` file shows some examples of usage of some LaTeX 
essencials. Also, check the `preferences.tex` file, you need to set the 
configurations for your thesis.
